# Django-Python-Web-Application
Work done with Prosper IT Consulting Dev Ops Team


# Live Project

## Introduction

I took part in a non-paid internship with Prosper IT Consulting working as a software developer as part of a Dev Ops team that worked on building a project that is a web scraping application built with Django and Beautifulsoup.  The application will gather data from the web that is relevant to the user, who is looking to travel.  It will include weather, flights info, events, restaurants, etc.  We will be getting the data with webscraping and APIs.

This project leveraged the power of .NET frameworks and MVC.  The main programming language used was C# in addition to the front-end languages.

Below are descriptions of stories I helped work on in an AGILE environment along with code snippets and navigation links.

For Python Live Project I was able to work on 2 projects as well

The first was a single story on a legacy project that essentially was being removed so it was more of a practice

The idea was to take and add to an existing app that provided recipes based on the search of the user ... the request was linked to an API that helped sort through a database of recipes based on the search parameters of the application and the choice of the user.

For the main project I worked on called TravelScrape

I did both back-end focused work for a sprint and front-end focus for a sprint

Titles:

EB-4599-NewAppBudgetApp Grounds up back and front design for a budgeting app that could help the user plan and budget for potential trips then implemented to Django.

EB-4616-CleanUpDashboard Setting up the dashboard as the main relay or switchboard for the user to connect with each app that was being built. Improving also upon the visual side to help the user have a friendlier experience.

EB-4732-Front-end-FixTemplates

EB-4780-BugFixSortRenderingDependencies Probably My Favorite*



### Other Skills

* Teaming with a group of developers working to identify both front-end and back-end issues/bugs and finding solutions to improve usability and efficieny in an application.
* Attending stand-up meetings physically and remotely, discussing any questions or concerns with team members to improve overall organization and communication.
* Practice with Team/Pair Programming when a developer has issues solving a particular problem.
