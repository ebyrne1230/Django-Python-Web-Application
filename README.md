# Django-Python-Web-Application
Work done with Prosper IT Consulting Dev Ops Team



For Python Live Project I was able to work on 2 projects as well

The first was a single story on a legacy project that essentially was being removed so it was more of a practice

The idea was to take and add to an existing app that provided recipes based on the search of the user ... the request was linked to an API that helped sort through a database of recipes based on the search parameters of the application and the choice of the user.

For the main project I worked on called TravelScrape

I did both back-end focused work for a sprint and front-end focus for a sprint

Titles:

EB-4599-NewAppBudgetApp Grounds up back and front design for a budgeting app that could help the user plan and budget for potential trips then implemented to Django.

EB-4616-CleanUpDashboard Setting up the dashboard as the main relay or switchboard for the user to connect with each app that was being built. Improving also upon the visual side to help the user have a friendlier experience.
